# Snake Game in C++ using Raylib Library
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game written in C++ using the Raylib library. The project is designed for educational purposes, particularly for learning data structures and implementing them manually, without relying on provided high-level libraries.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (Supporting C++11)
- Raylib Library

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/J-yphen/Snake-Game.git
```
2. Install Raylib Library:
Follow the instructions provided on the [Raylib GitHub repository](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) to install Raylib library for your platform.
3. Compile and Run:
Simply open this repository as a workspace in Visual Studio Code and press F5 to compile and run the project.

## How to Play
- Use arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.
- The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
